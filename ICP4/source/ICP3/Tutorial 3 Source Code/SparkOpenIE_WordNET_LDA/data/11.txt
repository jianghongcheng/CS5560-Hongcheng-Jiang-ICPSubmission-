I know that you probably don't feel much loved by me right now, but I want you to know that I do love you very much. You are my reason for everything. I look at you and I feel like a teenager in love for the first time. The way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you hold me makes my knees weak. I want you to know that no matter how many rough times we go through, that feeling is always there, and I will always wonder what I did to make you love me. Why would such a wonderful guy love me? I don't know, but I am so thankful and proud that you do.
